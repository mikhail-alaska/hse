## Data flow diagrams

### 1. User registration/authorization

### 2. The ability to control active sessions

### 3. The ability to find other users


![2025-09-16-at-12-14-57.png](pr1-img/2025-09-16-at-12-14-57.png)

### 4. The ability to send messages to each other/to a group chat


![2025-09-16-at-12-15-39.png](pr1-img/2025-09-16-at-12-15-39.png)

Between any number of users a chat is created. The id of the chat and its members is stored in the "Chat database". Any message 
in the chat is written to the "Messages database", with the chat id and metadata.

### 5. The ability to send files


![2025-09-16-at-12-17-35.png](pr1-img/2025-09-16-at-12-17-35.png)

To the previous flow of a message a "Media database" and storage server are added. The uploaded media is uploaded to the storage, with a unique id,
which is then written to the "Media database", with any important metadata.

## Trust levels

| id| Name | Description|
| -- | --| --|
|1|Guest|An unregistered user, with access only to the login/register page|

## Assets
Assets represent the points of interest for an attacker. This messengers assets can be divided in four groups:
1. Database - Any information, stored in a database
2. Users - Managing user access
3. Media - Any media in the storage
4. Server - Any activity done on the server

## Usage scenarios

1. A personal chatroom, to keep in touch with your friends and loved ones
2. A group chat of a cybersports team, to talk about future strategies and past mistakes
3. A cloud server for keeping media (using a fake account and sending to it tons of content, abusing the free storage)
