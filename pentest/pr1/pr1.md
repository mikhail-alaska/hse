### 4. The ability to send messages to each other/to a group chat


![2025-09-16-at-12-15-39.png](pr1-img/2025-09-16-at-12-15-39.png)

Between any number of users a chat is created. The id of the chat and its members is stored in the "Chat database". Any message 
in the chat is written to the "Messages database", with the chat id and metadata.

### 5. The ability to send files

To the previous flow of a message a "Media database" and storage server are added. The uploaded media is uploaded to the storage, with a unique id,
which is then written to the "Media database", with any important metadata.
